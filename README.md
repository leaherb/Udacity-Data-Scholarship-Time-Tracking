See also: https://erbin.website/StudentTimeTrackingProject/

## Hypothesis
According to the Scholarship Program, the Descriptive Statistics course requires 5-10 hours of study per week to complete within the 3 available months.

The Student Time-Tracking Project attempts to validate the Programâ€™s estimate using our personal experience, taking into consideration the hours we spent participating in the Challenge outside the formal classwork.

## Process - Collecting data
1. Students keep track of how they spend time in the Challege using a spreadsheet (template).
2. Near end of Challenge (instructions here: https://erbin.website/StudentTimeTrackingProject/upload-timesheet/), each student will:

   a. analyze their own data using any method they prefer. For example: spreadsheet functions, python code, and SQL scripts
   
   b. upload their time sheet along with answers to a few data analysis questions 
   
3. After July 27, 2018, project leader(s) consolidate individual spreadsheets, clean and summarize group data, and make it available for further analysis.

## Process - Consolidating and summarizing group data
Create Group Summary.ipynb (or, python version: Create Group Summary.py)

## Process - Evaluating and analyzing data
Analyze output from step 1, 'timesheet_summary.csv', in any way you see fit. Some examples are provided here.
