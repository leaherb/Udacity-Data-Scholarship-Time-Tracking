# Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Challenge of 2018
## Student Time Tracking Project

## Introduction
A great way to solidify what we've learned is with a real-life project. I created the **Student Time Tracking Project** to analyze how fellow students spent time in the _Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Challenge_.

## Hypothesis
According to the Scholarship Program, the Descriptive Statistics course requires 5-10 hours of study per week to complete within the 3 available months.

The **Student Time-Tracking Project** compares the Programâ€™s estimate with our personal experience, taking into consideration the hours we spent in class as well as participating outside the classroom.

## Process - Collecting data
1. Students kept track of how we spent time in the Challege using a spreadsheet (template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m_D0KKph0BVcfIvBYXccSFjcuTLLdyiNwF0UiGcKPEQ/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Near end of Challenge (instructions here: https://erbin.website/StudentTimeTrackingProject/upload-timesheet/), each student:

   a. analyzed their own data using their perferred method, for example: spreadsheet functions, python code, and SQL scripts
   
   b. uploaded their time sheet, along with answers to a few data analysis questions (https://erbin.website/StudentTimeTrackingProject/
   
3. Near the end of the Challenge, I consolidated individual spreadsheets, cleaned and summarized group data, and make both the clean and the raw versions of the data available for further analysis.

## Process - Consolidating and summarizing group data
### Code
Create Group Summary.py 
concatenate_standardized_timesheets.py (after timesheets are cleaned and standardized, write them all in one CSV file)

### Sample Data
See sample_timesheets directory

## Process - Evaluating and analyzing data
Analyze output file 'timesheet_summary.csv', generated by 'Create Group Summary' code. 

## Findings and Conclusions
Students are invited to add their findings and conclusions to the directory: findings_and_conclusions
